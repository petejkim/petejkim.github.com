The super secret side project I&rsquo;ve been working on with the guys
behind [Denso](http://www.getdenso.com/) -
[Arun](http://twitter.com/iamclovin), [Kent](http://twitter.com/ntluan),
and [AJ](http://twitter.com/ajhit406) is now up and it is called
[Journey for Mac](http://www.journeyformac.com/).

The app is open-source, and you can download its source code
[here](http://github.com/JourneyForMac/Journey). Please bear in mind
that this started as a hackathon project and many decisions were made
based on the speed of implementation, so you may find things that are
rough around the edges.

We&rsquo;ve tried to test-drive the app as much as possible with
[Specta](http://www.github.com/specta) and
[Expecta](http://www.github.com/expecta).

You can learn more about the story behind its creation
[here](http://dev.anideo.com/2012/02/26/introducing-journey-the-unofficial-path-client-for-os-x.html).
